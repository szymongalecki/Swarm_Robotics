## Program analysis
Program analysis offers static compile-time techniques for predicting safe and computable approximations to the set of values or behaviours arising dynamically at run-time when executing a program on a computer.

A main applications is to allow compilers to generate code avoiding redundant computations, e.g. by reusing available results or by moving loop invariant computations out of loops, or avoiding unnecessary computations. 

Among the more recent applications is the validation of software.

### Static analysis
Examining the source code without executing it.

### Dynamic analysis
Observing the behaviour of the system during execution.

### Analysis techniques
- Abstract interpretation
- Type checking
- Data flow analysis
- Control flow analysis
- Runtime verification
