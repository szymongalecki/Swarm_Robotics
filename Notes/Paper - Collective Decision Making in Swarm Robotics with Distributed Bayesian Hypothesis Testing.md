Note on [[Collective Decision Making in Swarm Robotics with Distributed Bayesian Hypothesis Testing.pdf]]

[[Primary problems within collective decision making]]
[[Collective decision making strategies]]

This paper assumes that agents have distributed perception but have to reach a consensus in order to adjust the collective strategy when solving a task.

Author mentions [[Collective decision making strategies]] as a starting point for presenting his idea - Distributed Bayesian Hypothesis Testing (DBHT).
