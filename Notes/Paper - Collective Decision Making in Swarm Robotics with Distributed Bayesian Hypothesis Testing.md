This paper assumes that agents have distributed perception but have to reach a consensus in order to adjust the collective strategy when solving a task.

Author mentions [Collective decision making strategies](Collective%20decision%20making%20strategies.md) as a starting point for presenting his idea - Distributed Bayesian Hypothesis Testing (DBHT).
