Progress:
- Checked  [Publications of Alessio Lomuscio](../Notes/Publications%20of%20Alessio%20Lomuscio.md).
	- All publication in above document are about **swarm** but none of them are about **testing**.
	- [Verifying Emergent Properties of Swarms](../Alessio%20Lomuscio%20Papers/Verifying%20Emergent%20Properties%20of%20Swarms.pdf) seem to be the most interesting for my research objective. Unfortunately I didn't understand much of it. 
- Completed a small tutorial on UPPAAL and recreated example systems.
	- [Mutex in UPPAAL](../Notes/Mutex%20in%20UPPAAL.md)
	- [Time in UPPAAL](../Notes/Time%20in%20UPPAAL.md)
	- [Verifying properties in UPPAAL](../Notes/Verifying%20properties%20in%20UPPAAL.md)
- Article [Formal Specification and Verification of Autonomous Robotic Systems: A Survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3342355) that I received from you was already used to find the articles that I presented on our feedback session last week.
