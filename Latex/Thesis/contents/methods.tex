\section{Methods}



\subsection{Aggregation}
We will use Manuele Brambilla's \cite{Brambilla2013} taxonomy of collective swarm behaviors, in Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy}, to show the context for the modeled aggregation behavior. Behaviors categorized as spatially-organizing distribute robots and objects in space. These behaviors serve as fundamental building blocks for more advanced swarm behaviors, as they enable robots to connect, communicate, and interact with one another. Aggregation, the simplest of collective behaviors, groups all robots of a swarm in a region of the environment. If we assume that the robots' environment is unbounded we will have two design choices. The aggregation algorithm will either have to allow a robot to reconnect with the group or never let it disconnect from it. The first approach involves access to external information about the position of the swarm e.g. robot coordinates. The second approach relies on robots being initially connected.

\subsection{Beta Algorithm}
The Beta algorithm is a robot swarm aggregation algorithm introduced by Julien Nembrini. It is his next iteration of the aggregation algorithm that relies on situated communication. Robots do not have information on their environment and the exact location of other robots. They are connected if they are within communication distance of the physical signal they are using. In the previous approach of the Alpha algorithm, robot movement was determined by the number of connections to other robots. In the Beta algorithm robot uses information about its connections as well as about connections of its connections. Robot when losing a connection will consider how many of its neighbors, are connected to the disconnected robot. If the number of neighbors that are connected to that robot is equal to or lower than the beta parameter, the robot will turn back in an attempt to reconnect. This aims at preventing a previously observed situation where a single robot would disconnect from the swarm without triggering its reaction as the remaining robots would have a satisfactory number of connections. In the event of high swarm congestion, a robot will choose a random direction.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code]
Create list of neighbours for robot, Nlist
k = number of neighbours in Nlist
i = 0

loop forever {
	i = i modulo cadence

	if (i = 0) {
		Send ID message

		Save copy of k in LastK
		Set reaction indicator Back to FALSE
		k = number of neighbours in Nlist
		Create LostList comparing Nlist and OldList

		for (each robot in LostList) {
			Find nShared, number of shared neighbours
			if (nShared <= beta) {
				Set reaction indicator Back to TRUE
			}
		}

		if (Back = TRUE) {
			turn robot through 180 degrees
		}
		else if (k > LastK) {
			make random turn
		}
		
		Save copy of Nlist in Oldlist
	}
	Steer the robot according to state
	Listen for calls from robots in range
	Grow Nlist with neighbours IDs and connection info
