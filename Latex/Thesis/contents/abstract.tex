Swarm robotics is a field where multiple simple robots work together to perform tasks without relying on a central controller. This paper focuses on the Beta algorithm, which is designed to keep robots connected through communication with nearby robots, without knowing their exact positions. The Beta algorithm is modeled using timed automata and implemented and verified using UPPAAL. Verification focuses on examining how efficient the Beta algorithm is in preventing the robots of the swarm from disconnecting. Both asynchronous and synchronized versions of the algorithm are explored to examine the influence of the mode of concurrency on the effectiveness of the algorithm.
