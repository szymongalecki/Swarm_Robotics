\noindent
Explanation of properties:\\
1. There is no state of the system where there are no available transitions.\\
2. After initialisation, all robots have set direction.\\
3. It is not possible for any robot to reach the corner of the grid.\\
4. All robots will always stay inside the grid boundaries.\\
5. There exists a path for the system where a robot will do a 180 degree turn without reaching the boundary of the grid. This means that transition from location \texttt{if} to \texttt{turn\_180} is taken.\\
6. There exists a path for the system where a robot will do a 180 degree turn as a consequence of reaching the boundary of the grid. This means that transition from location \texttt{grid} to \texttt{turn\_180} is taken.\\
7. There exists a path for the system where a robot will reach the \texttt{turn\_random} location after initialisation.\\
8. There exists a path for the system where a robot will make the transition from location \texttt{else\_if} to \texttt{forward}.\\
9. There exists a path for the system where all robots get disconnected after having moved forward for more than two steps each.\\
