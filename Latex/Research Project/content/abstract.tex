\section{Abstract}
This report explains the implementation details of the Alpha algorithm using a network of timed automata. The Alpha algorithm was selected due to its presence in the literature. We utilized the UPPAAL tool as it is suitable for modeling and verifying real-time systems. Work includes an explanation of the implementation process in UPPAAL, simplifications made to the algorithm, and the connection between design choices and the anticipated physical behavior of the model. We demonstrate how the composition of these models creates a system that executes the Alpha algorithm in a robot swarm. The paper also describes the parameterization of the system and the mechanisms for communication, as well as the limitations imposed to reduce state-space complexity. Correctnes of implementation is verifed using properties defined on the system.
