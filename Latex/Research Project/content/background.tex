\section{Background}
\subsection{UPPAAL}
"UPPAALÂ is an integrated tool environment for modeling, simulation and verification of real-time systems. It is appropriate for systems that can be modelled as a collection of non-deterministic processes with finite control structure and real-valued clocks, communicating through channels or shared variables. Typical application areas include real-time controllers and communication protocols in particular, those where timing aspects are critical." \cite{UPPAAL_in_a_Nutshell}

Swarm of robots fits within description of a system that can be modelled using UPPAAL. It is a collection of non-deterministic processes - single robots, that are defined using finite control structure - algorithm that is transformed into finite state machine. Swarm has to communicate and it can be achieved using channels or shared variables. Finally the emergent behaviour is a result of individual robot behaviour which is influenced by the passing time.
