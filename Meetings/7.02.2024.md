Progress:
- Problem statements for research project and thesis
	- [[Problem statement for research project - corrected]]
	- [[Problem statement for master thesis]]
- Contacted SAP regarding supervision - Niclas Tobias Kloe
- Watched introduction lecture to research by Luca Maria Aiello
- Started research
	- [[Papers - overview]]
- Keywords that result in more relevant papers:
	- testing $\rightarrow$ verification
		- Papers didn't mention how the testing was done but just that it has been done through the use of virtual simulators or hardware.
	- swarm robotics $\rightarrow$ swarm engineering
		- Papers didn't mention any formal logical system for defining swarm behaviour.

Questions:
- Can I use AI tool for grammar and style corrections? [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/write)
- Do you want to have access to my work through GitHub repo or self-hosted page with notes?
- Topics of literature review?
	- Formal logical systems used in modeling robot behaviours.
	- Appropriate verification methods for chosen modeling system.
	- Available simulators that satisfy above requirements.
- Main current objective?
