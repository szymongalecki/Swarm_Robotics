Progress:
- Problem statements for research project and thesis
	- [Problem statement for research project - corrected](../Formal/Problem%20statement%20for%20research%20project%20-%20corrected.md)
	- [Problem statement for master thesis](../Formal/Problem%20statement%20for%20master%20thesis.md)
- Contacted SAP regarding supervision - Niclas Tobias Kloe
- Watched introduction lecture to research by Luca Maria Aiello
- Started research
	- [Papers - overview](../Notes/Papers%20-%20overview.md)
- Keywords that result in more relevant papers:
	- testing $\rightarrow$ verification
		- Papers didn't mention how the testing was done but just that it has been done through the use of virtual simulators or hardware.
	- swarm robotics $\rightarrow$ swarm engineering
		- Papers didn't mention any formal logical system for defining swarm behaviour.

Questions:
- Can I use AI tool for grammar and style corrections? [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/write) $\rightarrow$ Yes
- Do you want to have access to my work through GitHub repo or self-hosted page with notes? $\rightarrow$ Yes

Explore:
- What is the difference between model checking and analysis?

Feedback:
- Expand literature search with **test case generation** and **scenario generation**
- Check what patterns and properties are verified
- What types of behaviours are defined? (ex.  consensus)
- There are not many definitions in swarm robotics
- I can use AI tool for grammar and style corrections
- I should host my notes so that they are available online
