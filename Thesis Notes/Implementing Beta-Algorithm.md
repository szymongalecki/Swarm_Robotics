Create list of neighbours for robot, Nlist
k = number of neighbours in Nlist

loop forever {
	i = i modulo cadence

	if (i = 0) {
		Send ID message

		Save copy of k in LastK
		Set reaction indicator Back to FALSE
		k = number of neighbours in Nlist
		Create LostList comparing Nlist and OldList

		for (each robot in LostList) {
			Find nShared, number of shared neighbours
			if (nShared <= beta) {
				Set reaction indicator Back to TRUE

		}

		if (Back = TRUE) {
			turn robot through 180 degrees

		else if (k > LastK) {
			make random turn
		}
		Save copy of Nlist in Oldlist
	}
	Steer the robot according to state
	Listen for calls from robots in range
	Grow Nlist with neighbours IDs and connection info
