Advanced modeling of $\beta$-algorithm that will include collision avoidance.
As the algorithm was tested, let's do verification with different modes of concurrency as the base work claims that asynchrony will work and I highly doubt that. Modeling and verification will be done in UPPAAL and it would be nice to do some sort of visualisation of traces in a tool that I could connect to UPPAAL, maybe Gazeebo???
