### How did I find the articles?
[Papers - overview, w6](Papers%20-%20overview,%20w6.md)
I initially used the search term "testing swarm robotics" to find relevant articles. While I managed to find multiple articles, they were not relevant to my research topic.
Word "testing" in the search term resulted in many papers which indicated that testing was performed but through the use of virtual simulators or hardware. Testing in the context of those papers most of the time meant: observation of the behaviour emerging from defined algorithms. Consequently, the effect of testing was modification of the algorithm and further observation. I wanted to find papers with more rigorous definition of what exactly is being tested that is why I changed the "testing" part of the search term to "verification".
Term "swarm robotics" resulted in finding general papers, often overview papers summarising previous research. They were not very specific and didn't specify any formal logical system for defining swarm behaviour. I found more relevant results after changing search term from "swarm robotics" to "swarm engineering".
