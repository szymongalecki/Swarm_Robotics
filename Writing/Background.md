UPPAAL is based on a timed automata, which is a finite state machine extended with a finite set of real-valued clocks progressing with the same speed. Clock values can be compared to integers in order to create guards that enable or disable transition between states. Clock values can be reset individually, creating possibility to reuse defined guards and control the frequency of operation. They constitute to the state of the system in the same way as locations of all automata and variable values.
