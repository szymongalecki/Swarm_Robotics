"UPPAALÂ is an integrated tool environment for modeling, simulation and verification of real-time systems. It is appropriate for systems that can be modelled as a collection of non-deterministic processes with finite control structure and real-valued clocks, communicating through channels or shared variables. Typical application areas include real-time controllers and communication protocols in particular, those where timing aspects are critical." ( https://uppaal.org/features/ )
